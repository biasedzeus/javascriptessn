            <h2>Extracting a substring from a string</h2>
            <p class="main_text">
                <h3>You can extract a substring from a string using the slice() method. You pass it:
                </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>the index at which to start extracting</li>
                    <li> the index at which to stop extracting. This is exclusive, meaning that the character at this index is not included in the extracted substring.
                       
                </ul>

                <code> 
                    const browserType = 'mozilla';
                    console.log(browserType.slice(1, 4)); // "ozi"</li>
                </code>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <hr>
                
               
               
               <p>
                The character at index 1 is "o", and the character at index 4 is "l".
                So we extract all characters starting at "o" and ending just before "l", giving us "ozi".
               If you know that you want to extract all of the remaining characters in a string after a
              certain character, you don't have to include the second parameter. Instead, you only need to 
              include the character position from where you want to extract the remaining characters in a string.
               Try the following:
               </p>
                
               <code>
                browserType.slice(2); // "zilla"
            
               </code>
            <p>
                This returns "zilla" â€” this is because the character position of 2 is the letter "z", and because you didn't include a second parameter, 
                the substring that was returned was all of the remaining characters in the string.

            </p>
